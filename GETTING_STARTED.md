## Technologies

Live Center is being built as a React/Redux hybrid web app, at least for the time being:

React: <https://facebook.github.io/react/>

Redux: <http://redux.js.org/>

We are using the Material-UI package for react to handle UI and transitions:

Material-UI: <http://www.material-ui.com/>

NPM for package management:

NPM: <https://www.npmjs.com/>

and Webpack for bundling the thing:

Webpack: <https://webpack.github.io/>

## For the Backend

We will be building the API to connect to the video streaming services - here are some hints as to the direction we might go with this:
